# [flask-meme-generator](https://flask-meme-generator.herokuapp.com/)
A flask app to generate random memes from Reddit 

I've started thinking about efficient ways to deploy ML models and interact with real users.
As I'm moslty using Tensorflow and there is a Python and Js version.
I sarted learning Flask and React Js.


Check this [simple flask app](https://flask-meme-generator.herokuapp.com/) that generate random memes from Reddit trough [Gimme memes API](https://meme-api.herokuapp.com/gimme).

it was inspired by [This video](https://youtu.be/5aYpkLfkgRE/) from NetworkChuck Youtube Channel.
